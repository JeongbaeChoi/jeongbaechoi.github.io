Abstract
---

Purpose – This article presents an in-depth philosophical investigation into the foundational tensions and conceptual uncertainties within information literacy (IL) research.
Design/methodology/approach – This study adopts an aporetic approach—one that highlights the productive role of (seemingly) unresolved contradictions in philosophical inquiry–to explore how persistent puzzles can serve as catalysts for conceptual, theoretical and philosophical renewal in the field. It draws on a comprehensive critical literature review involving over 600 publications, gathered via database searching and snowball sampling.
Findings – The study maps a constellation of six aporias: (1) truth, (2) knowledge and data, (3) information behavior, (4) genericism versus contextuality, (5) ideology and political economy and (6) illiteracy. These aporias are further synthesized into two overarching dilemmas–philosophical/conceptual and social/practicalwhich reveal enduring fault lines across IL research.
Originality/value – This research offers a comprehensive mapping of conceptual and philosophical aporias in IL. By foregrounding these tensions, it calls for sustained theoretical engagement and interdisciplinary dialog, both of which are essential to advancing IL scholarship.
