- **Abstract**

The rapid growth and expansion of information literacy (IL) research and practice notwithstanding, IL continues to suffer from challenges in integrating diverse approaches and findings from both LIS and other disciplines. Against this backdrop, this poster will give an overview of the recent development in information literacy over the last decade (from 2013 to 2022). The review will highlight the following aspects: (a) new topics receiving overall attention (b) conceptual and theoretical development, (c) educational and pedagogical aspects of IL, and (d) the application of IL in diverse disciplines and domains. To this end, the author conducted two studies: a topic modeling analysis and a meta-review. Utilizing the BERTopic model and the Web of Science database, the topic modeling analysis gained 44 topic clusters from 3,621 articles. Based on the results, the research conducted a thematization. For the meta-review, Web of Science, LISTA, and Education Source were used to collect relevant literature reviews. As a result, 53 relevant articles were identified for the meta-review. Some suggestions for future research will be suggested based on the findings identified from the review. 

Learning Outcomes: What are the relationships between IL in general and IL in specific domains? How do the researchers address the interdisciplinarity of IL? How do the researchers and practitioners design IL education?
