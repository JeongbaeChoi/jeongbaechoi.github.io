**Jeongbae Choi** is a PhD candidate at the School of Information Studies, [Syracuse University](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeongbae-choi/).

I study **how information and technology can expand people’s real freedoms**—what individuals can be and do with them. To advance this agenda, I work at the **interface of theory and practice in library and information science (LIS)**, from foundational philosophy of information, science, and technology to the applied design and evaluation of education, practice, and policy.

**Methodologically,** I use conceptual analysis and critical realist synthesis alongside qualitative, comparative policy, and design-based research.

**Key focus areas:** Informational well-being and informational agency, Information/data/digital/AI literacies, Library education and learning theories, Historical librarianship, Social and community informatics, Critical data and AI studies, Information policy, and Smart cities. 
(See more at my [Publications page](https://jeongbaechoi.github.io/publications/).)

For my **dissertation** study, I reframe Information Literacy as Capability (ILaC)—combined capabilities for informed beings and doings—based on realist approaches, through the integration of critical realism in the philosophy of science, social realism in curriculum studies, and the capability approach in political economy. 

**Current research topics:** Information Literacy as a Capability (ILaC), Librarianship as an Integrative Science (L-IS), Information Communities for Social Transformation, and Reformulating the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy. 

I hold bachelor’s and master’s degrees in sociology from Seoul National University (South Korea), a bachelor's in library and information science from the National Institute for Lifelong Education (South Korea), and have professional experience as a social sciences librarian at SungKyunKwan University.
